In this work, we attempt to land a UAV on an unmarked moving platform using visual servoing. All the previous approaches usually mark the platforms with AR Tags, identification markers etc.

## Description

A visual servoing based controller is used to perform the landing maneuvers using platforms coordinates and velocity information.

We use contour detection and optical flow for platform detection and tracking.

The findings were published at IMSD-ACMD at IIT Delhi under the paper titled [UAV Landing on General Moving Platforms Without Markers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zx5Pa_gA46OLOfMQFzY1kqcJJhRmZqQ6/view?usp=sharing)
