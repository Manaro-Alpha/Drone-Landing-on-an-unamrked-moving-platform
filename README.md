In this work, we attempt to land a UAV on an unmarked moving platform using visual servoing. All the previous approaches usually mark the platforms with AR Tags, identification markers etc.

## Description

A visual servoing based controller is used to perform the landing maneuvers using platforms coordinates and velocity information.

We use contour detection and optical flow for platform detection and tracking.
